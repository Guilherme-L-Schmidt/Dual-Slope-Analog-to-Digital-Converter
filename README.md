# Dual Slope Analog to Digital Converter

This repository contains the project for a Dual Slope Analog to Digital Converter, built for the Digital Systems class.

## Part 1

Contains the BCD to 7 segments display decoder implementations in Verilog to be used during the project, accompanied by a pdf describing its development process with Truth Tables, Karnaugh Maps, Boolean Expressions and the Schematics generated.

## Part 2

Contains implementations of Type D Flip-Flops and accompanying Synchronous, Asynchronous and Behavioral counters, including a pdf detailing each module and containing its RTL representation.

## Part 3

Combines the previous two parts into a BCD 0 to 999 counter with integrated register and BCD to 7 segment display converter.

## Part 4

Cointains a Finite State Machine used to control the Dual Slope ADC and its integration with the previous Counter to act as a controler for the Converter.
